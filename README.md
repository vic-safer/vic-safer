### Bachelor & MSc @Ecole Polytechnique (Paris, France) | M.A. Statistics @UC Berkeley (California, USA)

---

As a Master's student specializing in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, and Statistics, I focus on translating advanced theoretical knowledge into deployable, high-impact AI/ML systems. I am passionate about the intersection of model rigor and production readiness, and am actively seeking roles (FDSE / Applied AI) where I can apply a robust software engineering and problem-solving mindset to real-world industrial challenges.

## ✨ Featured Projects

| Project | Description | Technologies Key to Deployment | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Class Project: Genetic Algorithm** | Developed a genetic algorithm to select the best features of any dataset, in order to predict the values of a target feature with regression methods. | Python | Private Repo |
| **Research Project: Membership Inference Security** | Analyzed the promise of quantization of models’ weights for improving Membership Inference Security (MIS). Developed an algorithm that **improved the average security metric by a factor of 10,000** compared to an equivalent SotA quantizer. | Python (PyTorch), Slurm | Private Repo |
| **Research Project: Anomaly Detection for Images** | Developed and trained **Convolutional Auto-Encoders** to detect abnormal images from an industry-based dataset (MVTec). Reached an **AUC of 0.95**, significantly outperforming PCA and linear auto-encoders. | Python (PyTorch) | [Paper](https://github.com/vic-safer/Anomaly-detection-in-images/blob/main/LRP_APM_Bauer_Sana.pdf) |
| **Class Project: Sub-event detection in Twitter streams** | Detected events occuring during a soccer game thanks to Twitter data. Processed text through different embeddings, selected relevant features and compared models performances. | Python (Pandas, Scikit, NLTK) | [Paper](https://github.com/vic-safer/Sub-event-detection-Twitter/blob/main/Sub_event_detection_in_Twitter_streams.pdf) |
| **Research Project: Multifractal Modeling in Finance** | Developed an algorithm to forecast market volatility and price options. Improved the **Markov-Switching Multifractal model (MSM)** to better fit complex financial returns distribution and enhance forecasting accuracy. | Python (Pandas, SciPy) | [Repo](https://github.com/vic-safer/PSC_Quantitative_model_MSM) |

## 💡 Important Note on Projects & Work

Due to the sensitive nature of academic research, a portion of my production-grade code remains private.

I am highly enthusiastic about discussing these projects and the architectural choices.
